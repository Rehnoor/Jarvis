# Jarvis

The name "Jarvis" taken inspiration from Tony Stark's "Just a Rather Very Intelligent System", will be a morning "assistant" who will help me keep track of my morning routine. Jarvis will be made using a Raspberry Pi 5 computer and will feature a custom wake up alarm and a morning task list that i can acknowledge completion of by pressing a button. In the future, I will possibly add calendar integration to allow "Jarvis" to announce tasks for the day.
